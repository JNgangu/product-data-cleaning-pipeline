# Product Data Cleaning Pipeline

## Overview
This project demonstrates a real-world data cleaning workflow using Python and Pandas.  
The goal was to take messy product data — with missing prices, inconsistent column names, and mixed date formats — and turn it into a clean, analysis-ready dataset.

---

## Steps
1. Load the raw product data from a CSV file.  
2. Clean and standardise column names.  
3. Remove unwanted characters (e.g. £ symbols).  
4. Convert text and numeric fields to correct data types.  
5. Handle missing values using mean and default replacements.  
6. Format all dates consistently as YYYY-MM-DD.  
7. Export the cleaned data as a new Excel file.

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Excel / CSV  

---

## Output
- **Cleaned_Product_Data.xlsx** — the final cleaned dataset ready for use.
