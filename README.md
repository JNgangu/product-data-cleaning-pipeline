Product Data Cleaning Pipeline
Overview

This project demonstrates a real-world data cleaning process using Python and Pandas.
The goal was to take messy product data — with missing prices, inconsistent formatting, and date issues — and turn it into a clean dataset ready for reporting or analysis.

Steps I Took

Loaded raw product data from CSV

Cleaned and normalised column names

Removed unwanted symbols (like £)

Converted text and price fields to correct data types

Fixed missing values using mean or default values

Formatted dates consistently (YYYY-MM-DD)

Exported a clean Excel file ready for use

Tools Used

Python

Pandas

Excel / CSV

Output

Cleaned_Product_Data.xlsx — cleaned version of the dataset

What This Shows

Data cleaning and transformation with Pandas

Handling missing or invalid values

Preparing real-world data for business reporting

Extra Notes

This project is part of a personal portfolio focused on data engineering and ETL practice.
The main focus was to simulate what a junior data engineer would do on the job when dealing with raw datasets.
